## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the webpages.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpages and making them visually appealing.

## Usage

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**: The homepage contains buttons for navigating to different recipes. Click on a button to view the recipe details.
2. **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe page includes:
   - An image of the dish at the top.
   - A list of ingredients required for the recipe.
   - Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.
   - A rating section on the right side to display the rating of the recipe.
   - A "Return to Home" button at the bottom of the page to navigate back to the homepage.
  
## Features

- **Single CSS for Recipes**: All recipe pages use a common CSS file (`styles.css`) to ensure consistent styling across the pages.
- **Separate CSS for Homepage**: The homepage has its own CSS file (`home.css`) to keep the styles distinct from the recipe pages.
- **Easy Navigation**: A "Return to Home" button is provided on every recipe page for easy navigation back to the homepage.
